# K-Means-clustering
#Customer Segmentation using Kmeans clustering
Mart sales data set consist of below 5 features
Customer ID,Gender,Age,Annualincome,Spending score.
Based on Annual income,spending score of the customer is predicted
using K-Means clustering which is an unsupervised classification algorithm.
K value is chosed using elbow method.

stored in a array.
For better visualization,plotted scatter plot using matplotlib.
Each cluster denotes a  class of customers thereby
customers are segregated into different cluster
